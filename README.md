# Dynamic Hotkey Control for WinForms

A Windows Forms application that enables dynamic keyboard and mouse hotkey assignment to trigger buttons. Supports both fixed (e.g., F6, F7) and user-defined hotkeys, handling global low-level keyboard and mouse hooks.

---

## Features

- Dynamically assign hotkeys (keyboard keys or mouse buttons) to buttons at runtime.
- Support for multiple hotkeys linked to different buttons.
- Fixed hotkeys (F6, F7) trigger predefined buttons.
- Global hooks for keyboard and mouse to capture input even when the app is not focused.
- Real-time UI updates showing assigned hotkeys.
- Designed with Guna UI2 controls for modern UI experience.

---

## How It Works

- Click **Set Hotkey 1** or **Set Hotkey 2** buttons to enter hotkey assignment mode.
- Press any key or mouse button to assign it as the hotkey for the corresponding button.
- Press assigned hotkeys to trigger respective button clicks.
- Fixed hotkeys F6 and F7 also trigger specific buttons as fallback.
